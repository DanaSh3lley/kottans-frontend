I already had experience with the Git, so there was almost no new information for me in this course.
In any case, repeating the basic principles of working with the git was not superfluous.

Quite a fun game - I wish I had stumbled upon it earlier when I was just getting to know the git. Anyway, it was quite interesting and I'd love to do the rest of the levels, too.
